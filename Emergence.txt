# Emergence
## Naming

Emergence is a bad name. That's a fact. The name is one of the most important things there is to a software. The 
name decides if the user will use it. 

So, I have to change the name. The right question to ask is: what will the game be about? It's about evolution, 
planet exploration and species descoveries.

### Evolution

	Let's look for synonyms of evolution:
	+ change
	+ enlargement
	+ expansion
	+ growth
	+ progression
	+ transformation
	+ flowering
	+ increase
	+ maturation
	+ unfolding
	+ evolvement
	+ natural process
	+ working out 

	Seems alright. I will exclude some, which would definitively be bad names, and i have:
	- expansion
	- growth
	- transformation
	- maturation
	- evolvement
	- natural process

### Cosmic

	Synonyms of Cosmic:
	+ global
	+ grandiose
	+ huge

	+ planetary
	+ catholic
	+ cosmogonal
	+ cosmogonic
	+ cosmopolitan
	+ ecumenical
	+ empyrean
	+ measureless

	The ones I'll keep:
	- immense
